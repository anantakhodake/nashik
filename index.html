				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					Nashik was known by different names in different Yugas. According to Hindu legends, It was known as "Padmanagar" during Satya Yuga, "Trikantak" during Treta Yuga, "Janasthana" during Dvapara Yuga, and ultimately "Navashikh" or "Nashik" during Kali Yuga. During the Mughal period it was known as "Gulshanabad", the city of roses. Nashik has mythological, historical, social and cultural importance. The city is situated on the banks of the Godavari River, making it one of the holiest places for Hindus all over the world. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Rama, the King of Ayodhya, made Nashik his abode during his 14 years in exile. At the same place Lord Laxman, by the wish of Lord Rama, cut the nose of "Shurpanakha" and thus this city was named as "Nasik" as the word Nasik means nose in Sanskrit.

				<h2>climate</h2>
				<p>
					The city's tropical location and high altitude combine to give it a relatively mild version of a tropical wet and dry climate. Temperatures rise slightly in October, but this is followed by the cool season from November to February. The cool season sees warm temperatures of around 28 °C during the day, but cool nights, with lows averaging 10 °C, and extremely dry air.
