				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					The present temple was built by Shilahara kings who were native to
					Karnataka. Apart from the legend, the name might have originated from
					the ancient name of the town, which was "Koppam". The town witnessed
					two major battles. The first one took place in 1058 CE between
					Chalukya king Ahavamalla and Chola king Rajendra. The Chola king
					Rajadhiraja was killed during the battle, and the coronation of the
					second king, Rajendra Chola took place right on the battlefield.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					There are about a dozen inscriptions on the inside and outside of this
					temple, out of which only a couple of inscriptions are in good
					condition now. These inscriptions reveal the names of few kings and
					their officers. All these inscriptions except one are in Kannada
					language and script. The only Devanagari inscription in Sanskrit
					language is by Singhan-II and is located on the outer wall near South
					entrance of the temple.

				<h2>LEGEND</h2>
				<br />
				<p>
					It is believed that Daksha, who did not like his youngest daughter
					Sati marrying Lord Shiva, conducted a Yagna to which he did not invite
					the couple. Sati visited her father's house on Shiva's Nandi to
					confront her father. Dakhsa insulted her in front of the guests
					present at the Yagna. Unable to bear any further insults, Sati jumped
					in the fire of Yagna and immolated herself. When Lord Shiva came to
					know about it he was infuriated. He punished Daksha by severing his
					head.
				</p>

				<br />
				<p>
					Lord Vishnu pacified Shiva whereupon he restored Daksha's head but
					with a goat's head. The furious Shiva was brought to this place by
					Lord Vishnu to calm him down. Hence the temple got its unusual name as
					Kopeshwar (wrathful god). This explains why Lord Vishnu is in the
					temple in the form of a ling along with Shivling and Nandi is not seen
					in this temple as Sati rode on the Nandi while visiting her parents'
					home.
				</p>
				<br />

				<h2>FEATURES</h2>
				<br />
				<h3>Karul Ghat & Bhuibawada Ghat</h3>
				<p>
					The Kopeshwara, an ancient & artistic temple situated on the bank of
					Krishna is a fine example of ancient sculpture.The ceiling is
					semi-circular with matchless engravings. Inside there is a statue of
					Vishnu( Dhopeshwar) and Shivling " Kopeshwar " facing north. This is
					the only Shiva temple in India with an idol of Vishnu.
				</p>

				<br />

				<p>
					it is open to the sky with a circular opening. Looking at the sky one
					gets mesmerised and gets a feeling of looking at the heavens,
					justifies the name Svarga Mandap. At the periphery of the Svarga
					Mandap we can see beautifully carved idols of Lord Ganesh, Karthikeya
					swami, Lord Kubera, Lord Yamraj, Lord Indra, etc. along with their
					carrier animals like peacock, mouse, elephant etc. So at one glance we
					can see the Tridev ' Brahma Mahesh Vishnu '. A stone pedestal mounted
					east of the temple's southern door has a carved inscription in
					Sanskrit, written in Devnagari script . It mentions that the temple
					was renovated in 1136 by Raj Singhadev of yadav dynasty.
